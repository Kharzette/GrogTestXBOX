	Fix odd planet normals (maybe ship is backwards?)
	Draw a sun (maybe on yet another scale / proj matrix?)
	Need a time compression or sleep type system
	Heat generation with engine thrust
	Extend radiator functionality
	Power consumption
		Engines consume power to generate thrust
		Power units?	kWh / MWh
		Thrust units?  kN (kilonewtons)
		So engines would have a power to thrust ratio
		A perfect solidane generator should use 3.6 grams per watt per second
	Fuel usage
		Everything is electric so fuel generates electricity?
		Thinking the starting fuel should be some kind of future hydrocarbon
		Then later can get nuclear reactors for less fuel mass
	Portraits for communication
	Load all shaders and just switch with an offset
	Fix goofy resolution / aspect
	Rumble with engine throttle
	Sun/planets/roids
		20ish rocky planet textures
		10ish asteroid textures
		10ish moon textures
	Make some other ships
		Slow, old, leaky, beat up starter shuttle
		Freighters
		Frigates
		Fighters
		Cruisers
		Carriers
		Yachts for rich people
	Make some installations / orbitals
		Multiring stations
		Asteroid orbitals
		Military stations
	Audio?
	Regional market stuff / Stonks
	Gas giant moons
	Rockies
	Ice giants
	Currencies
		Physical
		Crypto
	Think about ship "sections" like engine area, living area, cargo
		Orient toward G
	G limitations for cargo types

Done
x	Physics numbers are big
x		Maybe use fractional tons for mass?
x	Waypoints, cycle through with dpad leftright
x	Figure out how to do huge distances
x	Get text drawing
x	Stop all the memory thrash of text
x	Think about camera for ship travel stuff
x	Figure out a way to do UI
x		Get basic Piloting UI working
x	Think about relative velocities (everything sol relative)
x		Maybe have outer stuff fixed in place for now? (no orbital mechanics)
x	planets		Textured spheres good enough?
x	planets		20ish gas giant textures
