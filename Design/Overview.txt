Mining
	Need a list of Stuff
		Minerals
		Volatiles
		Rarity?
	Big part of mining is Towing
		Big nets that hold material together for towing
	Refining
		Needs alot of power
	Tailings
		Use for concrete or asphalt type stuff
Shipyards
Defense
	Pirates
	Rivals
Installations
	Big pop orbitals
	Defense
	Corpo foundries / factories
	Military	
Research
	Propulsion
		Basic propulsion is electric
			resonant cavity thrusters
			ring stack
			casimir
		Gossamer drive
			This one makes ghostly wings
		Dark pulse drive
			Uses quantized accel / dark energy
			Harder to control
			Need secondary propulsion for fine control
			G forces too high for baseline humans
		RCS
			For turning etc
	Materials
		Armors
		Heat radiators
		Strength for construction
		Exotic properties (superconductors?)
	Magnetics/Ions
		Needed for propulsion, lithography
	Defense
		Lead slingers
		Beam weapons
		Marine Armor
		Ship Armor
	Medical
		Augments
			G resistance
			Uplinks
				Good for office workers
				Good for marines
			Blood nanomachines
				Just a raw heal time reducer?
		Life extension
		Rejuves
		DNA repair / rewrite
		Genetic hacking
		Synthetic Organs
		Pharma
			Cancer treatment
			Radiation treatment / resistance
	Products
	Computing
		Classical
			Lithography
			Optics
		Quantum
	Comms
		Radio
		Laser
		Entangled?
	Power
		Fission
		Fusion
		Solar
		Zeropoint?
Transport
	Higher speeds will ablate the front of ships
	Good to pack on ice in the front
Markets
	Food, fuel, stonks, air, water, products, personal gear
	Very localized due to lightlag
Colonies
	Big plan multiyear trips to other stars (future stuff)
Employees
	Welders
	Researchers
	Engineers
		Maintain engines etc
	Coders
	Factory Techs
	Bizzys / Marketing slime
	Medtechs
	Farmers
	ShipCrew
		Captains
		Gunners
		Marines
			Company Commander
		Spacers
		Navigators
		Shuttle pilots
Starting
	Start with a beatup old shuttle
	Maybe do hauling missions to build up cash
	Eventually buy an installation?
		haul it out to the kuiper belt and set up somewhere
		Can turn purchased material into products or
			mine and make ingots
	Or do military contracts
	Or do stonks
	Or do trading between markets
Midgame
	Specialize in products / services
	Start researching and staffing up
	Need to start thinking about defense
Endgame
	Defending against pirates and rivals alot
	bigger ships for bigger hauls
	vertical integration so you can make everything in the supply chain
Interface
	Look and Feel
		Mostly Dark Background
		Maybe lots of tabbed screens
			Triggers to swap tabs
		Non text elements (2d polygons?)
			Colored rectangle areas
			Rounded rects
				Empty or filled to indicate selection?
			Fat bracketed areas
			Thin lines for diagrams
			Meters
			Xbox button graphics
			Thin grids
			Waveform displays for comms?	
	Main Menu
		Start New Game
		Continue
		Settings
		Quit
	Piloting
		Regional indicator
		Velocity Indicator
		Acceleration in G
		Remaining fuel / air
		Cargo capacity stuff
		Passenger indicator?
		Nav / Waypoint stuff?
	On-Foot
		Weapon / Ammo stuff
		Air if in vacuum / suited
		Money
		Health
	Friendly Installations might have some of the following
		Hiring
			Lists of people ready to work for you
		Markets
			Buy and sell raw materials or finished goods
		Contracts
			Hauling, Hunting, Manufacturing, Guarding, Construction
	Personal
		Equipment / inventory
			Worn items, Weapons/Ammo, Air etc
	Ship
		Specs
		Swap out parts
		Damage details
		Cargo
		Passenger stuff
Traffic
	Ships are basically nukes x 100 so installations are jumpy
	Velocity is danger.  A small ship can kill a planet.
	Traffic control will want you to slow down on approach or will fire
Installation Modules
	These are snap together like legos
	Some will need to be spun for gravity
	Module Types
		Spun
			Habitation
			Research
			Medical
			Farming
		ZeroG
			Power
			Defense
			Refining
			Storage
				Tanks for volatiles (o2 water etc)
				Fuel
			Factory
			Comms
			Computing
			Refineries
				Metals
				Silicon
				Volatiles
				Carbons
